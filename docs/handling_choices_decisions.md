# Options and Decisions Management in a Visual Novel

## Introduction

Managing options and decisions is a critical component in visual novels, providing players with the ability to influence the story and explore different narrative paths. This document outlines how to handle options and decisions in a visual novel using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.

## Overview

In a visual novel, players are often presented with choices that impact the story's progression. To effectively manage these options and decisions, you need to:

- Display Options: Show choices to the player.
- Handle Input: Capture and process player selections.
- Update the Story: Change the narrative based on the chosen options.

## Code Structure

Here's a breakdown of the core components needed to manage options and decisions in Pygame:

- Display Options
- Handle Input
- Update the Story

### Define Story States

Create a dictionary to represent different story states and their options.

```python
story_states = {
    "start": {
        "text": "You find yourself at a crossroads. Do you go left or right?",
        "options": ["Go Left", "Go Right"],
        "next_states": ["left_path", "right_path"]
    },
    "left_path": {
        "text": "You encounter a friendly merchant. Do you talk to him or ignore him?",
        "options": ["Talk to Merchant", "Ignore"],
        "next_states": ["talk_to_merchant", "ignore_merchant"]
    },
    "right_path": {
        "text": "You stumble upon a hidden cave. Do you enter or walk away?",
        "options": ["Enter Cave", "Walk Away"],
        "next_states": ["enter_cave", "walk_away"]
    },
    "talk_to_merchant": {
        "text": "The merchant offers you a magical item. Do you accept or decline?",
        "options": ["Accept", "Decline"],
        "next_states": ["accept_item", "decline_item"]
    },
    "ignore_merchant": {
        "text": "You continue on your way and find a peaceful meadow.",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    },
    "enter_cave": {
        "text": "Inside the cave, you discover a treasure chest.",
        "options": ["Open Chest", "Leave"],
        "next_states": ["open_chest", "leave_cave"]
    },
    "walk_away": {
        "text": "You walk away and find a tranquil village.",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    },
    "accept_item": {
        "text": "You accept the item and gain a new ability.",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    },
    "decline_item": {
        "text": "You decline the item and continue your journey.",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    },
    "open_chest": {
        "text": "The chest contains gold and jewels. You are rich!",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    },
    "leave_cave": {
        "text": "You leave the cave and resume your adventure.",
        "options": [],
        "next_states": []
    }
}
```

### Display Options

Create a function to render options on the screen.

```python
def display_story(state):
    font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    
    # Display story text
    text = font.render(story_states[state]["text"], True, WHITE)
    screen.blit(text, (50, 50))
    
    # Display options
    options = story_states[state]["options"]
    y_offset = 150
    for i, option in enumerate(options):
        option_text = font.render(option, True, WHITE)
        screen.blit(option_text, (50, y_offset + i * 50))
    
    pygame.display.flip()
```

### Handle Input

Capture player input to select options.

```python
def handle_input(current_state, story_states):
    """
    Handle player input to select an option and update the story state.

    Args:
        current_state (str): The current state of the story.
        story_states (dict): A dictionary containing the different story states and their details.

    Returns:
        str: The updated state of the story after handling the input.
    """
    options = story_states[current_state]["options"]
    next_states = story_states[current_state]["next_states"]
    
    selected_index = 0
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()
            
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    selected_index = (selected_index - 1) % len(options)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    selected_index = (selected_index + 1) % len(options)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RETURN:
                    return update_story(selected_index, story_states, current_state)
        
        display_story(current_state)
```

### Update the Story
```python
def update_story(choice, story_states, current_state):
    """
    Update the story based on the player's choice.

    Args:
        choice (int): The index of the chosen option.
        story_states (dict): A dictionary containing the different story states and their details.
        current_state (str): The current state of the story.

    Returns:
        str: The new state of the story after the update.
    """
    # Retrieve the current story state
    state_info = story_states[current_state]

    # Ensure there are options and next states available
    if state_info["options"]:
        # Get the corresponding next state
        next_state = state_info["next_states"][choice]
        
        # Print or log the choice for debugging
        print(f"Player chose option {choice + 1}: {state_info['options'][choice]}")
        
        # Return the new state to update the story
        return next_state
    else:
        # No options available, return the current state (or handle end of story)
        print("No further choices available.")
        return current_state
```

### Main Loop

Integrate everything into the main loop to run the visual novel.

```python
def main():
    current_state = "start"
    
    while True:
        current_state = handle_input(current_state)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
