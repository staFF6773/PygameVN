# Environment Preparation in Pygame for Visual Novels

## Requisitos Previos

Before starting to develop a visual novel in Pygame, it is important to make sure that the development environment is properly configured. To do this, we need two key components: **Python** and **Pygame**. What these components are, why they are important, and how to install them are explained in detail below.

---

## 1. Python 3.6+

**Python** is a high-level interpreted programming language that is widely used in software development, including video games, web applications, automation scripts, data analysis, among others. Pygame is designed to work with **Python**, so it is essential to have it installed.

### Why is it important to use Python 3.6 or higher?

- Pygame is compatible with most recent versions of Python, but **some older versions of Python do not have the features and optimizations** that Pygame and other modern modules require.

- Versions above **Python 3.6** introduce improvements in performance, syntax and standard libraries, facilitating the development of more efficient and maintainable applications.

> **Note**: If you have a version prior to Python 3.6, it is recommended to upgrade it before starting. You can check your Python version by running the following command in your terminal or console:

```bash
python --version
```

Si ves una versión inferior a 3.6, debes descargar la más reciente desde el [sitio oficial de Python](https://www.python.org/).

## 2. Pygame

Pygame is a library that allows you to develop video games in Python in a simple way. It provides tools to handle graphics, events, sound, keyboard and mouse inputs, and many other functionalities needed to create a complete game or, in this case, a visual novel.

### Why is Pygame crucial for a visual novel?

- **Ease of creating 2D graphical interfaces**: Visual novels typically display images of characters, backgrounds and text. Pygame makes it very easy to load and render these images on the screen.

- **Event management**: You can manage user interactions, such as clicks and key presses, to navigate dialogs and story options.

- **Support for sound and music**: Visual novels also often have background music and sound effects to enhance the user experience. Pygame makes it easy to play sounds without the need to install additional libraries.

> **Note**: Installing Pygame: Once you have Python installed, you must install the Pygame library using the Python package manager, pip. This process is very simple and only requires the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Command explained:

- ``pip``: This is the Python package manager. It is used to install, update and uninstall Python libraries from the official repository.

- ``install`` pygame: Tells ``pip`` to install the ``pygame`` library in your Python environment.

> **Note**: Installation verification: To make sure that Pygame has been installed correctly, you can run this small Python script:

```python
import pygame
print(pygame.ver)
```

If the installation was successful, you will see a printout of the installed Pygame version.
